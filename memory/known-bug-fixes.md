# Known Bugs and Fixes

## IDE Import Resolution Bug in Symlinked Gateways

**Description:**
When editing files through a symlinked gateway (e.g., `~/.codex/`, `~/.agents/`, `~/.pi/`), you will often see IDE TypeScript errors saying:
`Cannot find module '../../[project-name]/...' or its corresponding type declarations.`

This happens because the IDE's TypeScript language server resolves relative paths based on the gateway symlink path, which points to physical repos that aren't located where the IDE thinks they are. For example, `../../` from `~/.codex/hooks` logically resolves to `~/` instead of `~/Developper/Projects/`.

**Generic Fix:**
Do **NOT** attempt to fix this by using hardcoded absolute physical paths or dynamic `require()`.

The established and cleanest fix is to preserve pure static relative ESM imports in the code, and use the `paths` compiler option in the gateway's `tsconfig.json` to map the logical paths back to their physical locations.

*Incorrect (Causes Portability Issues):*
```typescript
import { createEventSink } from "/Users/famillesendrison/Developper/Projects/telemetry-tools/event-sink/src/index.ts";
```

*Correct (Clean and Portable):*
```typescript
// In the source file:
import { createEventSink } from "../../telemetry-tools/event-sink/src/index.ts";
```
```json
// In ~/.codex/tsconfig.json:
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "paths": {
      "../../telemetry-tools/*": ["../Developper/Projects/telemetry-tools/*"],
      "../../dotagents/*": ["../Developper/Projects/dotagents/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Missing Global Types (Node/Bun) in Standalone Scripts

**Description:**
When writing standalone hook scripts (e.g., in `~/.codex/hooks/` or `~/.pi/agent/extensions/`), you may see IDE TypeScript errors for global execution objects like `process`, `Buffer`, or `import.meta.main`. 

This happens because the IDE's TypeScript language server evaluates these standalone files without the full Node or Bun global type definitions loaded.

**Generic Fix:**
Do **NOT** attempt to mask these errors by sprinkling `// @ts-expect-error` or `// @ts-ignore` throughout the code.

The established and robust fix is to ensure `bun-types` is installed at the root of the physical repository and explicitly included in the `tsconfig.json`. This provides true type-safety.

*Correct Implementation:*
1. Add `bun-types` to the root `package.json` (`devDependencies`) of the physical repo.
2. Add `"types": ["bun-types"]` to the `compilerOptions` of the root `tsconfig.json`.
3. If the IDE opens the project via a gateway (e.g., `~/.codex/`), ensure `node_modules` and `package.json` are symlinked from the physical repo into the gateway, and that `~/.codex/tsconfig.json` explicitly lists `"types": ["bun-types"]`.
